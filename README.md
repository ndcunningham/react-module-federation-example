## Module Federation

The main purpose of this project is to illustrate module federation using Nx.

Module federation splits your application vertically into separate buildable features. With this approach, a CI such as Nx Cloud can take advantage by distributing these builds across several agents.


## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.

Teams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nx’s advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.
